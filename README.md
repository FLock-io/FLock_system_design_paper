### Description

This is the code base for FLock's system design paper.

A short version of this paper has been accepted at [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/) workshop: [Decentralization and Trustworthy Machine Learning in Web3:
Methodologies, Platforms, and Applications](https://ai-secure.github.io/DMLW2022/)

You can check the full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04344).

### Codes

Detailed system design codes and experiments will be published later.
